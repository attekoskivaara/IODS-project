# About the project

I'm **excited** about the course. Open data science is an important part of academic research and therefore I wish to learn tools related to it.

**Exercise set 1:** With some earlier experience from R, this was an excellent reminder exercise. And there was also some new things as well - for example the flexible use of *mutate()*, *group_by()* and *summarise()* seems handy.
